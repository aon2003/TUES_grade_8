					Prince of Persia is a video game franchise
					created by Jordan Mechner, originally developed
					and published by Brøderbund, then The Learning Company,
					 and currently Ubisoft. The franchise is built around
					a series of action-adventure games focused on various 
					incarnations of the eponymous prince. The first game
					in the series was designed by Mechner after the success
					of his previous game with Brøderbund, Karateka.
					The original title spawned two sequels. The series has
					been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft,
					and has been made into a film, Prince of Persia: The 
					Sands of Time, penned in part by Mechner and released
					by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010. Since its first remake 
					of Prince of Persia, the series has seen eight sequels 
					on more than 10 different gaming platforms, from the
					Game Boy Advance to the PlayStation 3.
