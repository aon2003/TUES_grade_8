				Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is an action-adventure video game and sequel to Prince
				of Persia: The Sands of Time. Warrior Within was developed and published by Ubisoft, and 
				released on December 2, 2004 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Microsoft Windows.
				It picks up where The Sands of Time left off, adding new features, specifically, options in
				combat. The Prince has the ability to wield two weapons at a time as well as the ability to 
				steal his enemies' weapons and throw them. The Prince's repertoire of combat moves has been 
				expanded into varying strings that allow players to attack enemies with more complexity than 
				was possible in the previous game. Warrior Within has a darker tone than its predecessor
				adding in the ability for the Prince to dispatch his enemies with various gory finishing
				moves. In addition to the rewind, slow-down, and speed-up powers from Sands of Time, 
				the Prince also has a new sand power: a circular "wave" of sand that knocks down all 
				surrounding enemies as well as damaging them.
