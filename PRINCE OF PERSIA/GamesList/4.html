				The game follows an unnamed Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's city at
				the instigation of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince
				obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures
				an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the 
				Sands as a gift to the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into 
				releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Mechanic in the game is
				using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince makes a mistake platforming, and
				using it to kill and freeze enemies.
