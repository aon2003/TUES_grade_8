				The Prince finds out that he is being hunted by the Dahaka, 
				an incarnation of fate, because he interfered with time and 
				cheated his own death in the process. However, the Prince
				accidentally starts a conflict between Persia and India.
				Over the span of the game, the Prince fights the Deavas,
				a mythical race of demons contained in a box he opens,
				and Kalim, the Prince of India and brother of his long 
				lost love Farah. Because of the wars the Prince becomes 
				darker and matures. The game gives information as 
				to what happens in between the two games in the Sands of Time trilogy.
