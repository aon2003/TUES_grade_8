				The game combines exploration and combat. Both elements make use of the Prince's
				acrobatic capability and agility. Throughout much of the game, the player must
				attempt to traverse the palace by running across walls, ascending or descending 
				chasms by jumping back and forth between walls, avoiding traps, climbing structures
				and jumping from platform to platform, making other types of well-timed leaps,
				solving puzzles and using discovered objects to progress
