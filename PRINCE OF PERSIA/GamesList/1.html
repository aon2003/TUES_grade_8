				Prince of Persia is a 1989 fantasy cinematic platformer originally
				developed and published by Br√∏derbund and designed by Jordan Mechner
				for the Apple II. In the game, players control an unnamed protagonist
				who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the Grand Vizier
				Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess.

				Much like Karateka, Mechner's first game, Prince of Persia used rotoscoping 
				for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference
				for the characters' movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white 
				clothes and swashbuckler films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood.

				The game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success,
				sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original
				Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and 
				inspired many following games in this subgenre, such as Another World.[4] Its success
				led to the release of two sequels, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame
				and Prince of 3D, and two reboots of the series, first in 2003 with Prince
				of Persia: The Sands of Time, which led to three sequels of its own, and then again 
				in 2008 with the identically-titled Prince of Persia.
