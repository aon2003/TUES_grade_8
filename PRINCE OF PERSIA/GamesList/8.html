				The game is set in ancient Persia, with a player-character whose
				name is not revealed in the game. He is accompanied by a woman named
				Elika, whom he met after a large sandstorm diverted him from his 
				course and he ended up in a mysterious land. Players traverse many
				different environments using his acrobatic abilities to scale 
				walls and even crawl on the ceilings. Throughout the journey, 
				players combat various enemies as they attempt to cleanse the 
				land of corruption. The game's storyline and setting borrowed some aspects from Zoroastrianism.
