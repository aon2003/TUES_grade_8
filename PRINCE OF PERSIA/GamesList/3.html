				In 2000, a Sega Dreamcast version under the name Prince of Persia: Arabian Nights was
				developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive, which had previously 
				purchased both Red Orb Entertainment and The Learning Company. Many of the control flaws
				from the original PC version were corrected and other notable bugs were fixed, improving 
				the gameplay of this port, although it still suffers the same camera problems. This version
				was only released in North America.
